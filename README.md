# flask_basic_structure_template

#IDEA

Idea for this is that for any flask website you want to build you should be able to pull this and just copy paste your HTML/CSS/JS into it and it should work right off the bat. Of course you may need to also add your own routes to views.py and change the setup for database and how it connects(as in where to connect, what command it holds and what tables to talk to).
